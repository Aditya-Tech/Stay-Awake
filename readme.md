# Stay Awake!

Click [here] to view the site.

This web app is designed to keep you awake when you have to! Using motion detection technology, you will be alerted if you start dozing off for an extended period of time while using your computer. 

Google Chrome is highly recommended for optimal performance. 

Sensitivity scale can be viewed once the alarm has been started. It can be adjusted from 1 to 10, with ~8 being the best option for most users. If you tend to breathe heavily or move a lot in your sleep, a lower sensitivity might be best. If you don't tend to move a lot while working on your computer, a higher sensitivity is recommended.


Credits to much of the motion detection work go to Benjamin Horn (beije).
